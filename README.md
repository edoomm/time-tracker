# Time Tracker
Imagine having control of the weekly tasks you assign to your team in a **Google Spreadsheet** while having track of them in **Google Calendar**, **an AIESEC dream**, isn't it? Well, big news for you, that's what this **Time Tracker** does.
<br><br>
So if you are a TL, VP, etc. you will just need to fill the information required to your tasks or routines (**you can also create routines!**), give a few clicks and *voilà*! You and the responsible members of the tasks can watch their assignments in their **Google Calendars**!
